# ✨ **Hotel Recommendation System!** 🏨🌟

This project offers a vibrant and easy way to discover hotels based on your location and a short description of your trip. Simply run the cells in the `HotelRecommendation.ipynb` notebook to explore and get intelligent stay suggestions! 🗺️🚀

## ⚙️ **Setup and Installation** 🛠️

Ready to explore hotels interactively? Here's how to get started:

1.  **Clone the Repository** 💾 (if you have the notebook in a repository):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZeusDL/HotelHunch
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Required Libraries** 📦: Make sure you have all the necessary tools installed in your Python environment. You can usually do this within a notebook cell by running:
    ```python
    !pip install nltk numpy pandas
    ```

3.  **Download NLTK Resources** ⬇️: We need some language data to understand your requests! Run the following in a notebook cell:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('omw-1.4')
    nltk.download('punkt_tab')
    ```

4.  **Place the Dataset** 📂: Ensure the `Hotel_Reviews.csv` file is in the same directory as your `HotelRecommendation.ipynb` notebook.

## 🛠️ **Methods and Technologies Used** ⚙️💡

This smart hotel recommendation system uses the following techniques and tools:

* 🐍 **Python:** The main language powering this project, executed within the Jupyter/Colab environment.
* 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Using the fantastic `nltk` library for text understanding!
    * **Tokenization:** Breaking text into individual words with `nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize`.
    * 🛑 **Stop Word Removal:** Ignoring common words using `nltk.corpus.stopwords`.
    * 🌱 **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base form with `nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer`.
* 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering:** Matching hotels based on the similarity between their descriptions (tags) and your travel description.
* 📊 **Data Handling:** The amazing `pandas` library for managing and working with the hotel data.
* 🔢 **Numerical Operations:** `numpy` for basic numerical tasks.
* 🔓 **Safe String Evaluation:** `ast.literal_eval` for safely processing hotel tags.
* 🤝 **Basic Similarity Calculation:** Finding common keywords to determine the best matches.
* 📒 **Jupyter/Colab Notebooks (`.ipynb`):** The interactive environment for running and sharing the code and explanations.

## 📝 **Important Notes** 📌

* The better the hotel tags, the more accurate the recommendations! 👍
* This is a foundational recommendation system and can be made even smarter with more advanced NLP and by considering other hotel features and user preferences. 🤔
* Make sure the country names in the dataset are consistent for accurate results. 🌍
